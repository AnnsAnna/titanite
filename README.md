## Titanite

Titanite is (loosely) based on [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) with completely different goals and vastly different features. 

This version downloads the image of the tweet and includes a backlink to the original tweet. It is intended for preservation (Basically a Twitter/X bookmarks alternative that is actually good). It supports images, videos, text and mosaics, always trying to find the best way to showcase the content as directly as possible.

When sending it a tweet via DMs it'll automatically send it to a designated channel, it'll also include the original tweet link for easier moving to other channels / categories.

## Warning

Compared to the public [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) bot this bot is intended to only ever be used by one server/person given the differences, also, compared to [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) this bot is more-so a personal project with no support, I'd strongly recommend to use [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) instead unless you know what you are doing.
