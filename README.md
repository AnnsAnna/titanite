## Titanite

Titanite is a based of [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) with completely different goals. This version downloads the image of the tweet and includes a backlink to the original tweet and is intended for preservation (Basically a Twitter bookmarks alternative). Compared to the public [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) bot this bot is intended to only ever be used by one server/person given the differences, also, compared to [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) this bot is more-so a personal project with no support, I'd strongly advice to use [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene) instead.
