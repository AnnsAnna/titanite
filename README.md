## Sphene-Thorium

Sphene Thorium is a **hard fork** of [Sphene](https://github.com/AnnsAnna/sphene). This version downloads the image of the tweet and includes a backlink to the original tweet and is intended for preservation (Basically a Twitter bookmarks alternative). Compared to the public Sphene bot this bot is intended to only ever be used by one server/person given the differences.
